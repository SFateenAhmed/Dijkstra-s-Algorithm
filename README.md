# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
Dijkstra's Algorithm

EE442 COMPUTER AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS

This is a Python program to execute Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find minimum path between two nodes
in any given network. 

You can use network shown in Figure 3 as example.

The input is number of vertices, edges and cost of edges among vertices.
The out put prints all the vertices and their edges. Given two vertices as input, the code computes and prints the minimum path between those two nodes.
